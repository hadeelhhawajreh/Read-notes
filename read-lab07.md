 * A SCRIPT IS A SERI ES OF INSTRUCTIONS 
 # A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
 * Script are made up of instructions a copmuter can follow step-by-step.
 * A borwoser may use different parts of the script depending on how the user interacts with the web page.
 * Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
 
- To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

1: DEFINE THE GOAL 
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3: CODE EACH STEP
 # Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the:
 
* # Vocabulary ->
 The words that computers understand
* # Syntax ->
 How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow


*Along with learning the language itself, if you are
new to programming, you will also need to learn how
a computer achieves different types of goals using
a programmatic approach to problem-solving*
*You need to learn to "think" like
a computer because they solve
tasks in different ways than you or
I might approach them. *

# Computers solve problems programmatically;
they follow series of instructions, one after another.

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be rememberedbefore creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
 * Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
 * JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single values.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
